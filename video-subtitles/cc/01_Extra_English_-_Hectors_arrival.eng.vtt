00:00:14.612 --> 00:00:19.568
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
who share a flat in London.

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:22.599
They have a neighbour, Nick.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.358
Nick fancies Bridget.

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:28.359
But Annie fancies Nick.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.855
That's the way it is
until Bridget gets a letter from Argentina.

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.185
Stand by for Extra.

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:27.240
Is he stupid?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.570
I told you...

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:38.919
Sorry. B.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.201
Yes, John?

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.444
Yes, I got the cards
and the flowers and the chocolates.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.765
Yes. And I got the cushion as well.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.038
But it's finished. Sorry.

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:25.959
But please don't leave me.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.399
-  Don't cry.
-  I love you so much.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.238
Goodbye.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.632
Oh, and happy birthday.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.040
Ah, men!

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.080
Come on, Charley. Come on.

00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:48.884
Post, Bridget. Charley and I have the post,
haven't we, Charley?

00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:51.439
Give me the post, Charley.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.400
Give me the post, Charley.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.919
Drop it, Charley.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.640
Oh, good boy!

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.841
Telephone bill, gas bill, electricity bill.

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.421
What's this?

00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:16.959
A parcel for you, Bridget.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.960
Good. What is it?

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.320
Oh, it's from Mother.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:33.312
'Bridget darling, this arrived for you
and I made you this.

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.399
'Love, Mummy.'

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.498
Oh, very you, Bridget.

00:03:40.584 --> 00:03:42.878
Mother!

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.226
Ooh, this is from Argentina.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.798
Argentina? Who from? What does it say?

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.506
Erm, it says, 'Hello, do you remember me?'

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.439
No.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.413
'Seven years ago we was penpals.

00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:02.199
'We was...' We were penpals.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.467
Oh, yeah, now I remember. It's Hector.

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.078
Who's Hector?

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.889
He was my penpal seven years ago.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.599
Oh.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.598
'I speak English good now...'

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.016
I speak English good.
I speak English well now...

00:04:20.047 --> 00:04:22.278
'..and I am coming to England.'

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:25.279
Ooh, Latin Americans!

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
'I would like to sleep with you.'

00:04:33.428 --> 00:04:35.639
'Do you have a bed for me?'

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.726
Oh, he wants to stay here.

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.367
But, erm, what about the rules?

00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:58.465
Ooh, a Latin American here.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.919
Ooh, like Ricky Martin!

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.461
-  Tall, handsome...
-  Rich.

00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:14.870
So, erm, when is he coming?

00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:18.472
Oh, erm, let me see. It says...November 5th.

00:05:18.503 --> 00:05:22.456
Oh, November 5th. But that's...

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.089
Today!

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.798
Oh, it's you, Nick.

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:52.558
Hi, babes!

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.230
-  Hello, Nick. How are you?
-  Great.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.330
Nice muscles.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.759
-  Here's your milk.
-  Our milk?

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.760
You mean our milk
you borrowed three weeks ago.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.319
Oh, thanks, Nick.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.320
I forget nothing!

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.200
Would you like a drink, Nick?

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:34.403
Would you like a drink, Nick?

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.223
-  Uh- huh?
-  I said, 'Would you like a drink, Nick?'

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.359
Oh! Sorry.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.347
No, thanks.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.289
Oh, erm, Bridget's friend is coming.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.320
-  Oh, yeah?
-  Uh- huh. From Argentina.

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:06.651
Wow! From Argentina!

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:15.729
-  What's she like?
-  She is a he.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.996
-  Huh?
-  Not a girl, a boy.

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:26.606
Tough guy, eh?

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.760
Why don't I show you how to do it properly?

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.628
Nick, I've told you before,
nobody uses my bike. Nobody. Is that clear?

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:43.620
-  Well, why not?
-  Why not?

00:07:43.651 --> 00:07:48.418
If you touch my bike again, you are out.
O- U- T, out. Clear?

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:49.131
What?

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.031
I said...

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.848
-  Hello.
-  Hello.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:13.429
I am called Argentina. I am from Hector.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:16.829
You mean, 'I am called Hector.'

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.844
You are called Hector?

00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:21.858
Oh, no, no, no. I am called Annie.

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:23.638
I am called Annie.

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:29.710
No. She means, 'I am called Hector.
I am from Argentina.'

00:08:29.757 --> 00:08:31.686
You are from Argentina?

00:08:32.839 --> 00:08:35.839
Come in.

00:08:51.673 --> 00:08:52.790
Hello.

00:08:56.079 --> 00:08:59.079
-  Hi, babes!
-  Hello, Nick.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.015
I forget nothing.

00:09:15.883 --> 00:09:18.773
Nobody uses my bike. Nobody. Is that clear?

00:09:18.804 --> 00:09:20.836
-  Well, why not?
-  Why not?

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.163
I am called Argentina. I am from Hector.

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.415
My cars.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.919
You play with cars?

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.920
Yes. You play...no.

00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:52.359
I play with cars.

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:56.638
He plays with cars.

00:09:56.639 --> 00:10:01.129
I read. I love the library.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.999
Fascinating.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.257
We go to the library too, don't we, Bridget?

00:10:07.288 --> 00:10:10.640
Yes, it's great.

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:12.337
Good.

00:10:14.108 --> 00:10:16.171
I live here.

00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:20.289
You live in a museum, full of old things?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.368
Old things? Yes, I have lots of old things.

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.439
I live in a museum.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.440
OK, I live in a museum.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:37.335
Well, thank you, Hector.
And now we'll show you the flat.

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:41.577
This is the bedroom.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.759
Thank you.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.119
Who- hey!

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.479
Where do you sleep?

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.929
Er, no, you don't understand.
We only have one bedroom.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.849
One? I have 20.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.518
20?

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:08.046
Yes, he lives in a museum, with 20 bedrooms.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.264
Oh! Very funny, 20 bedrooms.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.480
Well, you can sleep here.

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:22.799
Oh, thank you.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.200
-  Oh, no, no, no, Hector.
-  Uh?

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:30.344
It's a bed.

00:11:30.375 --> 00:11:32.638
A bed? Oh, wow...

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:34.598
Oh...

00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:37.358
-  Here's a cushion.
-  Oh, thank you.

00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:41.726
Oh, this of course is the TV.

00:11:41.757 --> 00:11:45.562
But just relax. I must go to the bathroom.

00:11:47.119 --> 00:11:50.119
Psst! Annie! Bathroom!

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.523
Now!

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.624
Oh, my goodness. What are we going to do?

00:12:03.655 --> 00:12:05.278
He plays with toy cars.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:08.279
He is not a sexy Argentinian.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.478
But he is sweet.

00:12:11.479 --> 00:12:13.679
And he is polite.

00:12:15.214 --> 00:12:17.453
But those clothes!

00:12:17.484 --> 00:12:20.729
He is so old- fashioned.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.913
He must go.

00:12:43.239 --> 00:12:45.749
Room service.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.199
Hello. Who are you?

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.829
-  Oh. You are quick. Good.
-  Eh?

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.789
-  My luggage is downstairs.
-  What?

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:06.921
-  Bring it up, please.
-  What are you doing?

00:13:09.027 --> 00:13:14.068
I pulled, you come. You are the butler.

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:16.758
The butler?

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:19.759
I am Nick. I live next door.

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:24.598
I am Hector.

00:13:24.599 --> 00:13:28.492
Oh, Hector, from Argentina.

00:13:28.523 --> 00:13:31.000
Yes, from Argentina.

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:34.079
Where are the girls?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.679
-  The girls?
-  Yeah, Bridget and Annie.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.399
Oh, they live here.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.064
Yeah, I know. Where's Bridget?
Does she know you are here?

00:13:44.095 --> 00:13:48.172
Bridget, she gave me this.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.790
Hello, Nick. Oh, this is Hector from Argentina.

00:13:58.821 --> 00:13:59.638
Yeah, I know.

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:02.438
-  Isn't he wonderful?
-  Wonderful.

00:14:02.439 --> 00:14:04.918
-  Are you hungry?
-  Uh?

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:08.329
We'll buy your lunch.
What would you like to eat?

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.618
-  Fish and chips?
-  Oh, fish and ships!

00:14:15.539 --> 00:14:18.569
Erm, Nick, Hector, make friends?

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.600
Nick, teach Hector some English.

00:14:23.479 --> 00:14:25.638
Yeah, OK.

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:29.758
I'll teach Hector some English.

00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:49.946
Oh, you are quick. Good.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.251
I pulled, you come. You are the butler.

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.172
The butler?

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.360
She gave me this.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.546
I'll teach Hector some English.

00:15:42.846 --> 00:15:48.408
OK...this is the oven.

00:15:48.439 --> 00:15:51.198
This is the oven.

00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:54.809
Annie's dog sleeps in the oven.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.173
Annie's dog sleeps in the oven.

00:15:59.204 --> 00:16:03.985
So you say, 'Annie, the dog is in the oven.'

00:16:04.016 --> 00:16:07.663
Annie, the dog is in the oven.

00:16:08.999 --> 00:16:11.718
Great! Now Bridget.

00:16:11.719 --> 00:16:14.719
-  Oh. Oh, dear.
-  Huh?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.625
Well, Bridget likes strong men,
especially strong legs.

00:16:19.656 --> 00:16:21.480
I am strong.

00:16:21.511 --> 00:16:26.854
Yeah? Can you cycle 50 kilometres?

00:16:27.159 --> 00:16:29.078
-  Yes.
-  No way.

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:31.798
-  Yes.
-  Well, go on, then, show me.

00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:34.799
Yes, look.

00:16:41.725 --> 00:16:43.511
Adios, amigo.

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:10.112
Ah. Bridget, Annie, lunch.

00:17:10.143 --> 00:17:12.678
Fish and chips.

00:17:12.679 --> 00:17:16.168
Yes, lunch, Hector.

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:20.495
Look, Bridget, 50 kilometres.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.417
Oh, Annie, the dog is in the oven.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.503
What?

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.629
Hi. Everything OK?

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.198
Great!

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.730
I am... How do you say? Erm...

00:17:48.761 --> 00:17:49.502
-  Dead.
-  Hot.

00:17:49.533 --> 00:17:53.705
Hot. Yeah, I am hot. I need a...

00:17:53.736 --> 00:17:57.088
-  Shower.
-  Yeah, I need a shower.

00:17:57.119 --> 00:18:01.267
-  Be my guest.
-  Oh, thank you.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.650
Right, that's it. He must go.

00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:13.238
Why? He is so nice.

00:18:13.239 --> 00:18:15.237
He used my bike.

00:18:15.268 --> 00:18:20.853
Yeah, and he said that the dog was in the oven.
What a horrible joke.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.080
Where is Charley? Charley!

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.209
-  What a bad, bad boy.
-  He must go.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.609
-  Can he stay with you, Nick?
-  Uh- uh. Sorry, ladies.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.354
-  Oh, please, Nick. You have a spare room.
-  No way. Not my problem.

00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:40.169
-  He must go now.
-  But he's in the shower.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.917
I don't care.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.609
Hector, please come out,
we want to talk to you.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.422
I like fish and chips, I...

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:57.243
Hector, please come out, we want to talk to you.

00:18:57.274 --> 00:18:59.527
OK, one moment, please.

00:18:59.558 --> 00:19:02.198
I like fish and chips...

00:19:02.199 --> 00:19:05.199
Yes, you want me?

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.240
-  We think...
-  We...

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.280
We...we have a problem.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.679
It's like this.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.181
Go on, then, tell him.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.518
Yes, Bridget?

00:19:28.519 --> 00:19:31.519
Hector, the thing is...

00:19:41.199 --> 00:19:44.199
Stay there. I'll talk to him.

00:19:44.239 --> 00:19:47.239
Hector, can I have a word, please?

00:19:55.048 --> 00:19:57.672
Ricky Martin!

00:19:57.959 --> 00:20:00.959
Hector, is this you?

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.400
Yes, and my parents.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.205
'The Romero family,
one of the richest families in Argentina.'

00:20:12.719 --> 00:20:14.639
Who are these?

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.414
My...

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.744
-  Servants.
-  Yeah, my servants.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.072
-  Your cars?
-  Yeah, my cars.

00:20:30.321 --> 00:20:33.450
Hector, you are rich.

00:20:33.818 --> 00:20:36.457
Why stay here?

00:20:36.488 --> 00:20:41.038
I want friends. Good friends.

00:20:42.248 --> 00:20:45.248
People like you for your money?

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.436
That's awful.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.989
Erm... Listen, keep it a secret.

00:20:57.477 --> 00:20:59.756
-  OK.
-  OK.

00:21:00.001 --> 00:21:03.272
Perhaps he could stay here.

00:21:03.303 --> 00:21:06.231
Yes. Poor boy.

00:21:08.473 --> 00:21:11.296
Hector, come and stay with me.
I have two rooms.

00:21:11.327 --> 00:21:15.009
-  Shut up, Nick.
-  Hector will stay with us, won't you, Hector?

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.737
Hector, come and...sit down.

00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:28.509
Hector, please, call me Gigi.

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:35.159
Oh, Charley, there you are.

00:21:35.235 --> 00:21:38.626
Oh, Annie, the dog is in the oven.

00:21:38.657 --> 00:21:40.177
The oven?

00:21:40.723 --> 00:21:45.089
Yes. Nick is a good English teacher.

00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:49.982
Yes, a very good English teacher.

00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:56.917
-  I'd love to see your photos again.
-  Oh, me too.

00:22:01.176 --> 00:22:04.337
Oh, your sweet toy cars!

00:22:04.368 --> 00:22:07.206
They are not toys.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.273
Today Hector arrives and it's Bonfire Night.

00:22:11.508 --> 00:22:12.875
Let's party!

00:22:13.094 --> 00:22:16.181
-  What sort of music do you like?
-  Music?

00:22:16.316 --> 00:22:21.098
Yeah, music. You know, soul, funk, dance.

00:22:21.129 --> 00:22:22.361
Watch me. Like this.

00:22:29.768 --> 00:22:31.406
Interesting.

00:22:31.533 --> 00:22:35.586
I dance...like this.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.470
I'll get it. I'll get it.

00:22:50.949 --> 00:22:52.306
Hello.

00:22:53.278 --> 00:22:56.093
Oh, yeah, that's great.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.368
Sure. Come up.

00:23:01.403 --> 00:23:04.203
-  It's the landlady!
-  The tarantula!

00:23:04.234 --> 00:23:07.234
-  Quick, hide, Hector.
-  I'm off. I owe two weeks' rent.

00:23:22.813 --> 00:23:24.971
Next time in Extra...

00:23:25.002 --> 00:23:27.841
The flatmates go shopping for Hector.

00:23:27.872 --> 00:23:30.871
Hector goes shopping for the girls.

00:23:31.081 --> 00:23:34.935
But what happens
when Hector goes shopping for himself?
