<p>'Oh yes. I don't expect you to answer my question now. I had thought it might be called the "Mr Fielding High School" or perhaps the "King-Emperor George the Fifth".'</p><p>'Godbole!'</p><p>The old fellow put his hands together and looked charming.</p><p>'Is Aziz innocent or guilty? What is your opinion? Did he do it?'</p><p>'That is a difficult question for a Hindu to answer.'</p><p>'Don't tell me it's because good and evil are the same.'</p><p>'No. Not exactly. In our philosophy, no one performs an action in isolation All perform a good action, when one is performed, and when an evil action is performed, all perform it. I am informed that an evil action was performed in the Marabar Hills, and that a respected English lady is now seriously ill in consequence. My answer to the question is this - that action was performed by Dr Aziz.' He stopped for a moment. 'It was performed by the guide.' He stopped again. 'It was performed by you. It was performed by me. It was even performed by the lady herself. When evil occurs, it expresses the whole universe. Similarly when good occurs. Good and evil are different, as their names imply. But they are both aspects of my Lord. He is present in one and absent in the other. The difference between presence and absence is great. Yet absence implies presence. Absence is not non-existence. Therefore we are entitled to repeat, "Come, come, come, come".' Then, as if to cancel out any beauty his words might have contained, he added. 'But did you have time to visit any of the interesting Marabar antiquities?'</p><br>
