<h1>CHAPTER THREE</h1><p>Fielding had come to India when he was over forty. He had travelled a lot before he got the job at Government College. He was used to different kinds of people, and he enjoyed getting to know Indians. But he found that the other English people in Chandrapore disapproved of this. A joke he made at the Club one evening gave him a bad reputation. He said with a laugh that the so-called white race was really pinkish- grey. He did not realize that the symbolic value of the word 'white' was very important to the Anglo-Indians. It was scandalous to put the word 'white' into question. He realized that he could not be friends with Indians if he wanted to be liked at the Club. But he did not want to give up his Indian friends, so he lived between the two worlds.</p><p>His house at Government College was a beautiful old building in an ancient garden. Fielding was dressing after a bath on Thursday afternoon when Aziz arrived. He called through the bedroom door, 'Please make yourself at home.'</p><p>'How kind of you, Mr Fielding,' said Aziz. 'I am so pleased to meet you! I hear that you love Persian poetry and are interested in the Moghul Emperors. I am very interested in these things too. Don't you think that India must have been beautiful then?'</p><p>Fielding came out of the bedroom and said, 'Yes. It must have been splendid.'</p><p>'Who else is coming to tea?' asked Aziz.</p><p>'Two ladies - Mrs Moore and Miss Quested, and my assistant Narayan Godbole.'</p><p>Just then Mrs Moore and Miss Quested came in. Aziz found it easy to talk to them. Mrs Moore was so old and Miss Quested so plain that he felt entirely relaxed.</p>
