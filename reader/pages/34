<p>'Right... We will... Angels... Exactly,' said the men.</p><p>Just then the door opened and Dr Callendar came in. 'Miss Quested is a little better,' he said, 'but she still has a fever.'</p><p>'How is the old lady?' asked Mr Lesley.</p><p>'She has a fever too. Heaslop's on his way here.'</p><p>At the name of Heaslop a fine and beautiful expression appeared on every face. Miss Quested was only a victim, but Heaslop was a martyr. Heaslop - like all Englishmen in India - worked hard for the good of the Indian people, and this is how they repaid him!</p><p>'I wish I had never given my assistant the day off,' said Dr Callendar. 'Did you hear about Miss Quested's servant? Heaslop told the servant to stay with the ladies, but the prisoner bribed him to stay behind. And what about Mr Fielding? Why didn't he go on the expedition as planned? Money again.'</p><p>Fielding rose to his feet.</p><p>'I don't mean that they bribed you, Mr Fielding. They paid the other Indian to make you late. Godbole.'</p><p>'That's ridiculous,' said Fielding sitting down again.</p><p>Dr Callendar continued, 'And Aziz paid a crowd of natives to smother Mrs Moore in a cave. Then he went on alone with the girl. There was a guide too, but now he can't be found. It was all very well planned.' He raised his voice and cried, 'It's time to call in the army! It's time for action!'</p><p>Everyone ignored him, but he had disturbed them deeply. The crime was even worse than they had imagined. Fielding became thoughtful. The evil was propagating in every direction. It seemed to have an existence of its own.</p>
