'The worst thing in my whole career has happened.' he said at last. 'Miss Quested has been attacked in the Marabar Caves.'</p><p>'Oh no.' said Fielding, feeling sick.</p><p>'She escaped - by God's grace.'</p><p>'Oh no - not Aziz. It's absolutely impossible. Who accuses him?' asked Fielding.</p><p>'The victim herself,' said Mr Turton.</p><p>'Then she is mad,' said Fielding.</p><p>The Collector trembled with fury. 'Take back that last remark immediately!' he cried.</p><p>'I'm sorry, sir. I take back the remark,' said Fielding, for clearly the Collector was mad himself. 'I just cannot believe that Dr Aziz is guilty. Miss Quested must have made some mistake.'</p><p>'I have had twenty-five years' experience in this country,' said Mr Turton, 'and I have never known anything but disaster to result when English people and Indians try to be intimate socially. Newcomers ignore our traditions, and this is the result The good name of my district will be ruined for a generation! To think that an English girl fresh from England-'</p><p>It is impossible to regard a tragedy from two points of view. Turton had decided to avenge the girl. Fielding hoped to save the man.</p><p>'Where is Miss Quested now?' asked Fielding.</p><p>'She is ill.'</p><p>'How awful!'</p><p>The Collector looked at him with disapproval. Fielding was still interested in the facts. All over Chandrapore that day, the Europeans were abandoning their normal differences and becoming simply members of their community. They were filled with pity, anger and heroism, but they were incapable of logical thought.</p>
