The previous day, the Civil Surgeon had treated Nureddin after an accident. 'When he saw his face in the mirror, he cried. I laughed! I thought, the women won't like you now! I wish I could cut up Aziz too. Nothing is too bad for these people!'</p><p>'I agree,' said Mrs Turton. 'You men have been too weak, too kind to these natives.'</p><p>Just then they were called to the courtroom. The trial was about to begin.</p><p>The courtroom was crowded and very hot. Mr Das asked Mr McBryde to make his opening speech for the prosecution. McBryde's speech was not emotional. He described the expedition to the Marabar Caves in detail. He said that the prisoner was immoral, and that he had letters to prove it. At that point he took off his glasses and looked at the audience. 'Science has proven,' he said, 'that the darker races are physically attracted to the fairer, but not vice versa.'</p><p>Then a voice out of nowhere cried, 'Even when the lady is so much uglier than the gentleman?'</p><p>'Throw that man out!' said Mr Das.</p><p>A policeman took hold of a man who had said nothing and threw him out of the courtroom.</p><p>While Mr McBryde continued his opening speech, Adela looked around the hall. She saw all the people she had met in her silly attempt to see India. The Nawab Bahadur, other people she had met at the Bridge Party, and the prisoner himself. Close to him sat Fielding with an Indian child on his knee. When she met his eyes, he looked away.</p>
