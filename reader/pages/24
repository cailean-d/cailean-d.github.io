<p>'You are right!' cried Aziz and, going to the other extreme, he announced that no one could accompany them into the second cave except the guide. Mrs Moore watched as they climbed the hill towards the next group of caves. She took out her writing pad and wrote, 'Dear Stella and Ralph,' but then she stopped. She looked at the entrance to the cave she had visited. The more she thought of it, the more frightening it seemed. She could forget the smell and the heat, but the echo was unforgettable and terrifying. It seemed to say, 'Pathos, piety, courage - they exist but they are identical, and so is dirt. Everything exists but nothing has value.' The echo reduced all sounds to the same dull 'bou-oum'.</p><p>Adela, Aziz, and the guide climbed up the hill. The sun was getting hotter. Aziz had never liked Miss Quested as much as Mrs Moore. He had little to say to her and they walked in silence.</p><p>Adela was thinking about her marriage. She wanted to avoid becoming unpleasant to Indians like the other Englishwomen in Chandrapore. 'If I trust to common sense and goodwill,' she thought, 'my marriage will be happy and profitable.' But then she thought, 'What about love?' She and Ronny - no - they did not love each other.</p><p>'Am I walking too fast?' asked Aziz, for she had stopped with a doubtful expression on her face.</p><p>She was disturbed at this new realization that she did not love Ronny. Why had she never asked herself that question before? Should she break off her engagement? No. It was too late now. And perhaps love was not necessary to a successful marriage. 'No. I'm all right, thanks,' she replied. Aziz took her arm, and they continued climbing behind the guide.</p>
