<p>'Aziz, are you awake?'</p><p>'No. So let's dream of the future. We must spend all our vacations together. I want to take you to Persia. You shall be my guest, because I will have lots of compensation money.'</p><p>'You have won a great victory,' began Fielding.</p><p>'I know what you are going to say. You want me to excuse Miss Quested from paying compensation, so that the English will say, "This native has behaved like a gentleman." I am no longer interested in the approval of the English. I have become anti-British. The English have been the cause of all my troubles.'</p><p>'I am English.'</p><p>Aziz clearly did not want to talk about the English and Miss Quested any more, but Fielding insisted. 'You must excuse her from paying compensation. She must pay your costs, of course, but don't treat her like a conquered enemy.'</p><p>'Cyril, you are a nice man and my best friend, but in many ways you are a fool. You think the English will have more respect for me - and Indians in general - if I am kind to Miss Quested. You are wrong. They will see it as weakness. Anyway, I am going to leave British India. I will go to an Indian State, where the English cannot insult me.'</p><p>'I had a long talk with Miss Quested and I am beginning to understand her character. She is really very brave. In the courtroom, she realised she had made a mistake and she admitted it. I don't think I have that kind of courage. All her friends - all British India - wanted her to say that you followed her into the cave, but she said "No". Be merciful, Aziz, like one of your six Moghul Emperors.'</p>
