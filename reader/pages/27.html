<p>As they left the camp and returned on the elephant to the station Fielding asked Aziz, 'Where did you last see Miss Quested?'</p><p>Aziz pointed to the top of the steep hill.</p><p>'How did she get down? Did the guide help her?'</p><p>'Oh, yes. He was most helpful.'</p><p>'Is there a path down from the top of the hill?'</p><p>'Yes.'</p><p>Fielding could see nothing but a gully that ran straight down the steepest part of the hill. It was full of cactuses.</p><p>Mrs Moore fell asleep as they rode along. Mohammed Latif held her in his arms with efficiency and respect, to prevent her from falling off the elephant. Aziz felt happy. He had done his best to give his guests a good time. If they came late or left early, it was not important.</p><p>They got onto the train and moved slowly across the plain to Chandrapore. As soon as the train stopped in Chandrapore station, the door of their carriage was opened. There stood Mr Haq, the inspector of police. 'Dr Aziz,' he said, 'you are under arrest.'</p><p>'There must be some mistake,' said Fielding. 'What is the accusation?'</p><p>'I am not permitted to say. You must ask Mr McBryde.'</p><p>'We will. Come on, Aziz. Don't worry,' said Fielding. Aziz tried to escape out of the door on the other side of the carriage</p><p>Fielding held Aziz's arm. 'Dear fellow, we will go to McBryde together and ask what is wrong.'</p><p>'My children and my name!' cried Aziz.</p><p>They came out into the midday heat, arm in arm. Then Mr Turton called. 'Fielding, I must talk to you at once.' Fielding went to the Collector, and Aziz went off to prison alone.</p><br><br>
