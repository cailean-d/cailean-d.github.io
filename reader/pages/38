<p>'You're tired,' said Ronny.</p><p>'Ronny, he's innocent; your mother said so. I made an awful mistake.'</p><p>He looked through the window, but the Indian was gone. Adela touched her ear. 'My echo has stopped,' she said.</p><p>'My mother never mentioned his name,' said Ronny. 'You're confusing this with Fielding's letter.'</p><p>'Oh, yes! That must be it,' she cried.</p><p>'Mother, you didn't mention the prisoner's name just now, did you?'</p><p>'No.'</p><p>'I thought you said "Aziz is an innocent man" just then, when you were talking about love,' said Adela.</p><p>'Of course he is innocent,' answered the old lady: It was the first time she had expressed an opinion on the subject.</p><p>'Do you have any evidence in the prisoner's favour?' asked Ronny.</p><p>'I know people's characters. I have heard both English and Indians speak well of him.'</p><p>'That isn't evidence. Mother!'</p><p>'This is terrible,' said Adela. 'I'm still certain that he followed me, but can't I stop the trial? Oh, of course, it's impossible. I'm sorry I mentioned it. Please forgive me.'</p><p>'Of course I forgive you,' said Ronny. 'But the case has to come to trial now. The machinery has started.'</p><p>'She has started the machinery,' said Mrs Moore, 'and it will work to its end.'</p><p>Then Ronny had an excellent idea - his mother should leave India at once.</p><p>So, at her son's suggestion and by her own desire, Mrs Moore departed by ship from Bombay. When she was gone, the weather grew hotter. On the morning of the trial, Adela was very nervous. She went to the court with the Turtons. Children threw stones at the Collector's car.</p>
