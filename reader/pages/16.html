<p>'Are you frightened, Adela?' asked Ronny.</p><p>'No.'</p><p>'You should be frightened!' cried the Nawab.</p><p>'The driver must have lost control of the car,' said Ronny.</p><p>'No. It wasn't that,' said Adela. 'We ran into an animal. A large animal ran up and hit the car. I saw its hairy back.</p><p>The old man gave a loud cry. His terror seemed excessive and ridiculous. 'This happened because you took the Marabar road.' he said to his driver angrily.</p><p>'That's my fault,' said Ronny, and he explained.</p><p>They saw a car approaching, and Ronny stepped into the road and waved.
