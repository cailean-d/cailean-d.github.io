<p>Fielding said goodbye to the Collector and went to find McBryde, the Superintendent of Police.</p><p>McBryde was a thoughtful, educated man. He spoke to Aziz with courtesy and respect. He was shocked by the accusation against Aziz but not really surprised, because he had a theory about climatic zones. His theory was as follows: 'All unfortunate natives are criminals at heart because they live south of latitude 30.' Born in India, he seemed to contradict his own theory, and he sometimes admitted this with a sad smile.</p><p>'What is the accusation?' asked Fielding.</p><p>'That he followed her into the cave and made insulting advances. She hit him with her binoculars. He pulled her binoculars and the strap broke. She escaped. When we searched him, we found the binoculars in his pocket.'</p><p>'Did she say anything else?'</p><p>'There was an echo in the cave. It frightened her.'</p><p>'Did it make her nervous?'</p><p>'I couldn't ask her many questions. She was in a terrible state. Miss Derek said that when you'd gone to the camp, she saw Miss Quested running down the gully.'</p><p>'Was the guide with her?'</p><p>'No. She ran into the cactuses and got covered with cactus spines. Miss Derek helped her out of the cactuses, then took her to the car. When Miss Quested saw the Indian driver, she cried "Don't let him come near me!" Miss Derek drove her back to Chandrapore and straight to my bungalow. They are there now.'</p><p>'I wish I could talk to Miss Quested,' said Fielding. 'I think she has made a mistake. I am sure that Aziz is innocent.'</p>
