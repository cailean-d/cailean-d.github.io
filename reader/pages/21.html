<h1>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><p>The Marabar Hills are very ancient. The sea has never covered them. They were there before the Himalayas rose out of the ocean and before the Indian subcontinent broke off from Africa.</p><p>The caves are easily described. A tunnel leads to a circular cave about six metres in diameter. This is a Marabar cave, and there are many of them, exactly the same, in the Marabar Hills. The caves are dark. When a visitor arrives, he lights a match. The flame is reflected on the walls of the cave, which are smooth.</p><p>It illuminates the colours in the smooth granite of the wall - delicate stars of pink and grey. Then the match burns out and the cave is dark again like all the other caves.</p><p>Early one morning, Aziz and Mohammed Latif went to the train station to wait for the guests. Although his friends had advised him against it, Aziz was taking Mrs Moore, Miss Quested, Fielding and Professor Godbole on an expedition to the Marabar Caves. The ladies were the first to arrive, accompanied by their servant Antony. Aziz had been nervous, but now he was suddenly happy. 'Ah, you are here! This is the happiest moment in my life!' he cried. 'Send back your servant. Then we shall all be Moslems together!'</p><p>'Antony, go home,' said Adela.</p><p>'Master told me to come,' he replied.</p><p>Mohammed Latif gave Antony some money, and Antony left.</p><p>Aziz was getting nervous again. Fielding and Godbole had not yet arrived and it was almost time for the train to leave. He took the ladies onto the train and made them comfortable. Then he went back outside to wait for Fielding. But just then the train started to move. Aziz and Mohammed Latif leapt onto the moving train. 'Mr Fielding!' cried Aziz as the train left the station.</p>
