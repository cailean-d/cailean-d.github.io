Little shrines and tombs appeared and offerings were made to Esmiss Esmoor. Although Aziz was a Moslem, the cult of Esmiss Esmoor was a Hindu cult. Hindus and Moslems - always divided in the past - were united by the trial, and Aziz became a hero in the Indian community in general.</p><p>And a rumour began to circulate among Indians at Chandrapore. They said that while Miss Quested was staying in Government College, she and Fielding had been lovers. When Aziz heard it, he pretended to be amused, but he was deeply hurt. He felt that Fielding had betrayed their friendship by being intimate with his enemy. He also resented the fact that Fielding had not told him. He himself had told Fielding many secrets, but the Englishman had told him nothing in return.</p><p>Fielding and Aziz spent a great deal of time together, but their friendship was disturbed by misunderstandings.
