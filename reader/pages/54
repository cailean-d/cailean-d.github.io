<p>When Aziz got home, he found a note from Fielding. The note said that Fielding hoped to stay in Mau for two days. He was making a tour of inspection of schools in the Indian States. His wife and her brother were with him. They would like to go out in a boat that evening to see the procession. Could Aziz arrange it?</p><p>They didn't want to give any trouble... Aziz threw away the note. He had shown Miss Quested India before, with disastrous results.</p><p>Later that day, Aziz went for a walk with his children. Jamila held his hand. Ahmed and Karim ran in front, looking for a frog to put in Mohammed Latif's bed. The scenery around them was beautiful, though the land was wet from the rains, and the sky was grey. They could see the river in the valley below, the palace of a local queen, and the European Guest House. They passed an old building, a shrine to a Moslem saint. It had no roof, and bees had built their nests inside it.</p><p>Two Englishmen entered the shrine but ran out again pursued by bees. They were Fielding and his brother-in-law. The children laughed. Aziz had not intended to talk to his former friend, but the accident put him in a good mood. 'Hello, gentlemen,' he called out. 'Are you in trouble?'</p><p>The brother-in-law cried out: the bees had stung him. Aziz went up to the stranger and pulled two stings out of his wrist.</p><p>'Hello, Aziz,' said Fielding, but his voice was not friendly. 'Is he all right?'</p><p>'Oh yes. I have an ointment that will stop the pain. I will send it to the Guest House.'</p>
