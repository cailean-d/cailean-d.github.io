<p>Fielding and Godbole ran into the station, but they were too late - the train was going. 'I'm sorry!' cried Fielding. 'Godbole's prayers took longer than I thought!'</p><p>'This is a disaster!' cried Aziz.</p><p>Mrs Moore tried to comfort him. 'Dr Aziz, don't worry. Now we will all be Moslems together, as you said.'</p><p>Mrs Moore and Miss Quested did not enjoy the train ride to the Marabar Hills. The landscape was flat and dull The sunrise was disappointing. When they arrived at the Marabar train station, an elephant was there to take them to the hills. Aziz had spent a lot of money on the elephant. The ladies smiled politely when they saw it.</p><p>A crowd of local villagers met them at the station and followed them to the hills. Half way up the first hill, servants set up camp and prepared tea. Close by was the first of the Marabar Caves.</p><p>Mrs Moore, Miss Quested and Aziz drank tea and talked about the Moghul Emperors. Aziz felt happy now, even though Fielding was not there. The English ladies were his guests. His honor depended upon making them happy.</p><p>After breakfast they went into the first cave, followed by all the villagers. Humanity disappeared into the black hole in the hill. All was silent for five minutes, then humanity came out of the hole again with its noise and colour and life.</p><p>In Mrs Moore's opinion, the cave had been horrible - it was dark, hot, crowded and smelly. Mrs Moore had nearly fainted. A soft, naked thing had touched her face. She had hit her head and begun to panic. And there was a terrifying echo.</p>
