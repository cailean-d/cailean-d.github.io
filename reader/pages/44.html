<h1>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><p>Adela walked through the crowd of shouting Indians to the door of the courthouse and out into the street. Miss Quested, where are you going?' cried Fielding when he saw her.</p><p>'I don't know.'</p><p>'You can't walk around alone. Why don't you stay with your own people? Perhaps there will be trouble, and you will not be safe. Come this way. I'll put you in my carriage.'</p><p>'Cyril, Cyril, don't leave me!' cried Aziz.</p><p>'I'm coming back,' Fielding replied as he led Miss Quested to his carriage. She got into it obediently. Expecting the trial to last a long time, the driver had gone to visit a friend and had taken the horses with him. Fielding could not leave Adela alone in the carriage. The crowd was very excited. Two of Fielding's students came up and put a garland of flowers around his neck. 'Sir, we will be your horses. We will pull the carriage,' one said, pushing Fielding into the carriage next to Adela.</p><p>'Well, at least you are safe here,' said Fielding as the students pulled the carriage through the crowd. People spoke to them and put garlands around their necks. Some of them called Adela 'Mrs Moore'. Finally, they reached the peace and quiet of Government College and the exquisite blue arches of the garden-house.</p><p>Fielding tried to call McBryde, but the telephone lines had been cut. He could not leave Adela and go to celebrate with Aziz.</p><p>At that moment Aziz was crying, 'Cyril, Cyril...' He was riding in a carriage with the Nawab Bahadur, Hamidullah, Mahmoud Ali, and lots of flowers. Victory gave him no pleasure - he had suffered too much. He just wanted to be with his friends. 'Where is Cyril? Let's turn back.' But the carriage could not turn back. It was part of a procession that advanced down the street.</p>
