<p>'Really?' said McBryde in surprise. 'You are a schoolmaster, so you see them at their best, when they are boys. I see them when they are men. I know them as they really are. Look at this, for example.' He held up Aziz's wallet. 'There are some letters in here to a friend of his. He was arranging to see prostitutes in Calcutta.'</p><p>'Didn't you do the same when you were a young man? I did. Please let me see Miss Quested. I just want to ask her if she is sure that it was Aziz who followed her into the cave.'</p><p>'She is very ill. You have to ask Dr Callendar's permission to see her.'</p><p>They called Dr Callendar and received the expected reply: "no." 'Can I see Aziz?' asked Fielding.</p><p>'You have to ask permission first and I'm sure you don't want to disturb poor Heaslop at the moment.'</p><p>A policeman brought in the desk drawer from Aziz's bungalow.</p><p>'Photographs of women!'</p><p>'That's his wife,' said Fielding.</p><p>As Fielding left McBryde's office, he met Hamidullah. 'It's all a mistake!' said Fielding, holding his hand.</p><p>'We should have a Hindu lawyer to defend Aziz, so that we get the support of all Indians, not just Moslems,' said Hamidullah. 'I think we should have Amritrao from Calcutta.'</p><p>'Amritrao is a fine lawyer,' said Fielding, 'but he is anti-British. They hate him at the Club. They will consider it a political challenge if you hire him.'</p><p>'I don't care,' said Hamidullah. 'When I saw that dirty policeman carrying my friend's personal possessions into the office, I thought, "Amritrao is the man we want."'</p>
