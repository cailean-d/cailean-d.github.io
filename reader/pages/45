They hope to destroy us one by one. But they shall fail.'</p><p>Mahmoud Ali's words were repeated and soon the procession moved towards the hospital. The earth and sky were ugly. Evil was everywhere.

'No violence, please!' he cried. 'Aziz is free and Nureddin is safe.</p><p>Let's just go home and celebrate our victory. I will no longer use the title the British gave me.
