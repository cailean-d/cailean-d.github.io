<p>'When the prisoner and the guide took you to the other caves, was anyone else present?'</p><p>'No.' Adela remembered the rocks and the sun on her back.</p><p>'You walked up the hill to the next group of caves. Did you then go alone into one of those caves?'</p><p>'Yes.' She remembered the entrance of the cave and the darkness within.</p><p>'And the prisoner followed you into the cave?'</p><p>'Now we've got him!' said Dr Callendar.</p><p>Adela was silent. The court was waiting for her to answer, but she could not reply until she saw Aziz enter the cave in her mind's eye.</p><p>'The prisoner followed you, didn't he?' asked McBryde.</p><p>She waited, watching the entrance of the cave in her mind's eye, waiting for Aziz to come in, but he did not come. 'I am not quite sure,' she said at last.</p><p>'Excuse me?' asked McBryde, looking frightened. 'I didn't hear your answer.'</p><p>'I cannot be sure...'</p><p>'You entered the cave, then the prisoner followed you. Is that not right?'</p><p>'No,' she said. No one yet understood what was happening except Fielding, He saw that his friend was saved.</p><p>'What are you saying? Speak up, please,' said Mr Das.</p><p>'I'm afraid I have made a mistake.'</p><p>'What kind of mistake?'</p><p>'Dr Aziz never followed me into the cave.'</p><p>McBryde said, 'Miss Quested, let us continue. I will read you the words of the statement you signed in my bungalow two hours later.'</p><p>'Excuse me, Mr McBryde,' said Mr Das, 'but you can't continue. I am speaking to the witness myself. Miss Quested, please repeat what you just said clearly.'</p>
