<p>'Why didn't you answer my letters?' asked Fielding, but just then the rain became more intense. Fielding said, 'We will have to go back to the Guest House. Which is the quickest way back down to our carriage?'</p><p>'Down here.'</p><p>When they reached the carriage, Aziz opened the door and said, 'Come on, Mr Quested, Mr Fielding.'</p><p>'Who is Mr Quested?' asked Fielding.</p><p>'Do I mispronounce that well-known name? Is he not your wife's brother?'</p><p>'I'm Ralph Moore,' said the boy.</p><p>'Don't you know that my wife was Mrs Moore's daughter?' said Fielding. 'Perhaps this explains your strange attitude.'</p><p>'What attitude?' asked Aziz.</p><p>'That ridiculous letter you let Mahmoud Ali write for you. How did you make such a mistake?' asked Fielding in his old friendly voice. 'Miss Quested! What an extraordinary idea! She is our best friend and she introduced us, but why on earth did you think I had married her? Aziz, we must talk about this. If is all Mahmoud Ali's fault. He knows that I married Miss Moore. He called her "Heaslop's sister" in his insolent letter to me.'</p><p>Hearing Ronny's name made Aziz furious. 'She is Heaslop's sister, and this is his brother, and you are his brother-in-law, so goodbye! Yes, yes, I made a mistake. I thought you had married my enemy. I never read your letters. Mahmoud Ali deceived me. I thought you had stolen my money but-' he clapped his hands together and his children came to him - 'I forgive Mahmoud Ali because he loved me. My heart is for my own people from now on!'</p>
