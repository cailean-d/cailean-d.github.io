I too have two sons and a daughter.'</p><p>'What are their names? Not Ronny, Ralph and Stella?'</p><p>The suggestion delighted him. 'No, indeed. My children are called Ahmed, Karim and Jamila.'</p><p>They rose to leave. 'If you like,' said Aziz, 'I will show you the Minto Hospital. I have nothing else to offer.'</p><p>'I'm sorry.

I go immediately, but he is not there and does not even leave a message!'</p><p>She listened.</p><p>He was excited partly by the insults he had received but much more by the knowledge that someone sympathised with him.

'Indians are not allowed in,' he said, but his voice was no longer angry.</p><p>As Mrs Moore re-entered the Club, she heard Adela Quested say, 'I want to see the real India.' Adela was the girl who had travelled from England with Mrs Moore. Ronny had asked his mother to bring Adela to India. Ronny and Adela were thinking of getting married.</p>
