<h1>CHAPTER NINE</h1><p>Hundreds of kilometers west of the Marabar Hills, and two years later in time, Professor Godbole stands in the presence of God. God is not born yet - that will happen at midnight - but He was also born centuries ago, and He can never be born, because He is Lord of the Universe, who transcends human processes. He is, was not, is not, was.</p><p>Professor Godbole stood at one end of a long carpet. The God was at the other end - represented by a small silver image. Hindus sat on either side of the carpet, chanting.</p><p>The beautiful white palace at Mau was decorated for the holiday with many brightly coloured cloths and ornaments. The air was full of chanting voices, the ringing of little bells and the beating of drums. The poets of the state had written inscriptions for this holiday. Some hung in dark corners where no one could read them. One was written in English to indicate the universality of God. Unfortunately, the writer had made a mistake and the sign read, 'God si Love.'</p><p>Professor Godbole danced, wearing a blue turban. As he danced, he remembered an old woman he had met in Chandrapore. He concentrated his mind upon the old woman, calling her forward to the place where completeness can be found. The hour of the God's birth was near. The ruler of the state was brought in to watch it. He was old and ill. No one greeted the Rajah - this was not a moment for human glory. He sat on the carpet close to the altar and leaned against a pillar.</p><p>The clock struck midnight. The air was full of incense and the sound of bells. The God was born. All sorrow was annihilated, not only for Indians but for foreigners, birds, caves, railways and the stars. There was joy and laughter. Tears ran down the Rajah's tired old face. His attendants took him to his rooms, where Dr Aziz was waiting to give him a sedative.</p>
