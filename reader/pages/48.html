I will be away for two days.'</p><p>'No need for that,' said Hamidullah, looking out of the window. 'Here comes the City Magistrate.'</p><p>'At last,' said Adela.</p><p>'He comes, he comes, he comes.' sang Hamidullah.</p><p>'Will you ask him what he wants, Mr Fielding?'</p><p>'He has some news for you,' he said on his return. 'He is on the veranda. He prefers not to come in.'</p><p>Adela went out to talk to Ronny.</p><p>Fielding said to Hamidullah, Poor Heaslop. He has just received news that his mother died at sea. She was already dead this morning when they were chanting her name in the courtroom.'</p><p>'Really? I am sorry. I suppose it was the heat. This is no time for an old lady to travel.'</p><p>'Yes. Heaslop should never have let her go, and he knows it.'</p><p>'This is his punishment for sending our witness away before she could help us.'</p><p>'She couldn't have saved Aziz,' said Fielding. 'Only Miss Quested could have saved him.'</p><p>Miss Quested decided to stay at Government College. Fielding and Hamidullah drove out to Dilkusha with Amritrao. They decided not to tell Aziz about Mrs Moore's death until the next day. They did not want to ruin his victory party.
