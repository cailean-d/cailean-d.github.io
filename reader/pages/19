'Why don't you marry Miss Quested?'</p><p>'Oh, no! She's too serious. Anyway, she is engaged to marry the City Magistrate.'</p><p>'Is she? Oh well. Never mind. She has very small breasts. If you come with me to Calcutta, I shall find you a lady with breasts like mangoes!'</p><p>Fielding smiled, but he thought it bad taste to refer to a lady's breasts.</p><p>'No, you won't.'</p><p>'You are right. It might get you into trouble. Then you might lose your job.'</p><p>'If I do, I shall survive it. I travel light.'</p><p>'Travel light! You are a most extraordinary race. Is it your climate or what?'</p><p>'Plenty of Indians travel light too - holy men, for example. Any man can travel light until he has a wife and children. I'm a holy man minus the holiness.'</p><br><br><p>PART TWO</p>
