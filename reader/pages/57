<h1>CHAPTER TEN</h1><p>The sounds of chanting and music continued to come from the palace all day long. The festival continued, wild and sincere, and all men loved each other. Aziz had nothing to do all day, so just before sunset he took the ointment to the Guest House. As he rode up the hill, Aziz saw a boat on the lake below. The English had gone out to see the procession Aziz felt angry again. This English desire to 'see India' was only a way of ruling India.</p><p>When he reached the Guest House, he found the only servant asleep in the entryway. Aziz walked in and looked around. There were two letters on the piano in the living room. Aziz read them. He was not ashamed to do this. McBryde had read all his letters. One of the letters was from Heaslop to Fielding, the other was from Miss Quested to Stella.</p><p>'Oh, who is that?' said a nervous voice. Something moved in the darkness of the next room. Aziz could not remember where he had heard that voice before.</p><p>'The doctor,' he replied, putting the letters into his pocket. Ralph Moore came into the light. He was a strange boy, tall and old-looking with big blue eyes.</p><p>'How are your bee-stings?' asked Aziz, but his voice was not friendly.</p><p>'They hurt.'</p><p>'Come here, please, and let me look at them.'</p><p>They were alone. Aziz could treat the patient as Callendar had treated Nureddin.</p><p>When Aziz touched Ralph's wrist, the boy cried out, 'Oh, your hands are unkind!' Aziz looked at his hands. The extraordinary boy was right. Aziz replied angrily, 'That is a strange thing to say. I am a qualified doctor and I will not hurt you!'</p>
