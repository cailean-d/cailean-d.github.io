<h1>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><p>Adela lay for several days in the McBrydes' bungalow.</p><p>Miss Derek and Mrs McBryde spent hours looking at her skin, picking out hundreds of cactus spines. Everyone was kind to her - too kind. But the only person she wanted to see - Mrs Moore - did not come to visit her.</p><p>Her mood changed frequently. One moment she was cool and sensible, trying to explain what happened in the cave, then she burst into hysterical tears. She wanted to see Mrs Moore and ask her about the echo, which she kept hearing even now. Only Mrs Moore could stop the echo.</p><p>When the cactus spines had all been removed and her fever had gone down, Ronny came to take her home. He and McBryde told her about events that had taken place during her illness.</p><p>McBryde said, 'I'm sorry, Miss Quested, but you'll have to testify in court.'</p><p>Ronny said, 'Das - my Indian subordinate - will preside at the trial.'</p><p>They told her about the troubles during Mohurram - on the last day of the festival, the procession had left its usual path and come up to the Civil Station as a protest against the imprisonment of Aziz. Fortunately, the police had been able to prevent further trouble. Finally, McBryde showed her a letter that had come for her while she was ill. It was from Fielding. It said that Aziz was innocent.</p><p>As they drove to his bungalow Ronny said, 'Mother is glad that you're coming home. But remember that she is old. Don't expect too much.'</p><p>When they got to the house, they found Mrs Moore sitting on the sofa. Her face was very red. She did not get up when they entered. Adela sat down beside her and said, 'I am so glad to see you again. You are the only one who can help me. Everyone else is a stranger.'</p>
