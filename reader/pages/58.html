<p>'There is no pain, but there is cruelty,' replied Ralph.</p><p>The noise of the procession rose around them and the guns of the State went off. The Hindus were chanting the names of gods:</p><p>Radhakrishna, Radhakrishna,</p><p>Krishnaradha, Radhakrishna...</p><p>Aziz put the ointment on Ralph's bee-stings and said, 'I must go now. Goodnight.' Suddenly his anger left him and he shook Ralph's hand. 'You don't think me unkind anymore?'</p><p>'No.'</p><p>'How do you know?'</p><p>'I know if a stranger is my friend.'</p><p>'Then you are an Oriental.'</p><p>Those words! He had said them to Mrs Moore in the mosque at the beginning of the cycle from which, after so much suffering, he had got free. Never be friends with the English! Mosque, caves, mosque, caves. And here he was starting again He gave the ointment to Ralph. 'Keep it,' he said. 'I must give you one little present, and it is all I have. You are Mrs Moore's son.'</p><p>'I certainly am,' said Ralph.</p><p>'But you are also Heaslop's brother, and the two nations can't be friends.'</p><p>'I know. Not yet.</p><p>'Did your mother speak to you about me?'</p><p>'Yes. In her letters. She loved you.'</p><p>'Would you like me to take you out in a boat to see the procession?'</p><p>Aziz and Ralph went down to the water and got into one of the Guest House boats. The wind was rising and it blew the boat towards the procession. There was a flash of lightning, then another, and the rain poured down. The Hindus were singing and dancing, preparing to throw their God away into the water.</p>
