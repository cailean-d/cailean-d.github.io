'Yes. That's very true. Isn't it, Julie?' He looked at the young woman next to him.</p><p class="sent">Julie didn't answer and looked bored. She closed her eyes.</p><p class="sent">'Julie's my wife,' the young man told the man in the brown hat. 'She doesn't like trains. She always feels ill on trains.'</p><p class="sent">'Oh yes?' the man in the brown hat said. 'Now my wife - she doesn't like buses. She nearly had an accident on a bus once. It was last year... No, no, it wasn't. It was two years ago. I remember now. It was in Manchester.' He told a long, boring story about his wife and a bus in Manchester.</p><p>It was a hot day and the train was slow. There were seven people in the carriage. There was the man in the brown hat; the young man and his wife, Julie; a mother and two children; and a tall dark man in an expensive suit.</p><p>The young man's name was Bill. He had short brown hair and a happy smile. His wife, Julie, had long red hair and very green eyes - the colour of sea water. They were very beautiful eyes.</p><p>The man in the brown hat talked and talked. He had a big red face and a loud voice. He talked to Bill because Bill liked to talk too. The man in the brown hat laughed a lot, and when he laughed, Bill laughed too. Bill liked talking and laughing with people.</p><p>The two children were hot and bored. They didn't want to sit down. They wanted to be noisy and run up and down the train.</p>
