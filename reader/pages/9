<h1>CHAPTER TWO</h1><p>The Bridge Party was not a success. The Nawab Bahadur went to it and because he had accepted the invitation, others in the Indian community accepted also. His opinion was respected. He was a rich man and a philanthropist. He and his elegant grandson Nureddin stood on one side of the lawn outside the Club, surrounded by other Indians.</p><p>On the other side of the lawn Mrs Turton sat in a chair, surrounded by other English people. She was 'saving herself up' for some future occasion. Most of her public appearances were characterised by this air of reserve.</p><p>Mrs Moore and Adela tried to talk to some of the Indian ladies while Mrs Turton watched disapprovingly, but the ladies were polite and shy, and soon the conversation came to an end.</p><p>When the Bridge Party was over, Adela stood at the window of the Club, looking out at the Marabar Hills. Mr Fielding came up to her and said, 'Your friendliness gave great pleasure to our Indian guests.'</p><p>'I'm so glad,' said Adela. 'This party made me feel ashamed of the other English people. You, Mr Turton, and Mr McBryde were the only ones who were even polite.'</p><p>'Would you like to come to tea at Government College on Thursday?' asked Fielding. 'I could invite my assistant. Professor Godbole. And, if you like Indian music, we could ask him to sing.'</p><p>'That would be nice.'</p><p>'Shall I invite other Indians?'</p><p>'Do you know Dr Aziz?'</p><p>'No,' said Fielding. 'I have heard of him, but I have never met him. Shall I invite him too?'</p>
