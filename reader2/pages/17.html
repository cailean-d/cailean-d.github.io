<p>Three days after Fielding's tea party Aziz lay in bed, ill. It was a little fever. When he heard guests arriving, he felt suddenly worse.</p><p>Hamidullah came in with Syed Mohammed, the assistant engineer, Rafi, the engineer's nephew, and Mr Haq, the police inspector. They sat on his bed and talked. The room was small and dirty with many flies.</p><p>Just as they were beginning a stupid argument, Fielding walked into the room saying, 'Is he ill or not?'</p><p>'Sit down,' said Aziz coldly. He felt ashamed of his bungalow and his friends.</p><p>Hamidullah offered Fielding a cigarette. Fielding accepted. He liked the pleasant sensitive lawyer. 'He is ill and he is not ill, as we all are The whole world seems to be dying, yet it doesn't die,' said Hamidullah, 'so there must be a benevolent God. Don't you agree?'</p><p>'No, I don't,' said Fielding. 'The world is not dying and I don't believe in God.'</p><p>Aziz and the others were scandalized.</p><p>'Is it true that most people in England are atheists now?' asked Hamidullah.</p><p>'Most thoughtful people, yes.'</p><p>'And doesn't morality also decline?'</p><p>'Yes - I suppose it does.'</p><p>'Excuse the question but. if this is the case, how is England justified in ruling India?'</p><p>'I don't know,' said Fielding. 'I'm here because I need a job.'</p><p>'Qualified Indians also need teaching jobs.'</p><p>'I got there first,' said Fielding, smiling.</p><p>'But is it fair that an Englishman should have a job in India when Indians are available? Of course I mean nothing personal. Personally, we are delighted that you are here.'</p>
