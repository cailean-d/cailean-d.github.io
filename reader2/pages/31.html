<p>'Goodbye, then, my dear Hamidullah - we must drop the "Mr" now. Give Aziz my love, and tell him to keep calm.'</p><p>'Goodbye, my dear Fielding. Are you really on our side against your own people?'</p><p>'Yes. Definitely.'</p><p>Fielding went back to his office at Government College to write a letter to Miss Quested. Professor Godbole came in and asked him questions about work. At the end of the conversation, the old man said, 'I am glad to hear that you got to the Marabar Caves. I hope the expedition was a successful one.'</p><p>'Ah! You have not heard the news! Dr Aziz has been arrested!' said Fielding.</p><p>'Oh, yes. I have heard.'</p><p>'Well, an expedition where that occurs cannot be called successful!'</p><p>'I don't know; I wasn't there.'</p><p>Fielding stared at him, but it was useless. No eye could see to the bottom of the Brahman's mind. Yet he had a mind and a heart too and all his friends trusted him, without knowing why. 'I am very upset about it,' said Fielding.</p><p>'Yes, I can see that. I have just one more question.'</p><p>'Well, what is it?' asked Fielding wearily.</p><p>'You know I will soon be leaving Government College. I will be returning to Mau - my birthplace in Central India - to take care of education there. I want to start a high school that will be like Government College. The point on which I desire your help is this: what name should be given to the school?'</p><p>'A name? For the school?' asked Fielding. He lay his head on his arms. Sometimes Indians were unbearable. 'I can think of nothing but poor Aziz. Do you realise that he is in prison?'</p>
