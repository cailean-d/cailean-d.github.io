<p>'Are you married, Dr Aziz?' she asked.</p><p>'Yes.'</p><p>What a handsome little Oriental he was. No doubt his wife was beautiful too. She regretted that neither she nor Ronny had physical charm.</p><p>'How many wives do you have?' she asked, because Mrs Turton had told her that Moslems had several wives.</p><p>The question shocked the young man very much - it was offensive.</p><p>'One,' he said and let go of her arm. A few steps ahead of them were the entrances to several caves. Aziz ran into one of them to recover his equilibrium. Adela had no idea that she had said the wrong thing. Still thinking about her marriage, she too entered a cave.</p><p>Aziz waited in the cave for a minute, then went out again. He heard the sound of a car. Looking down at the plain, he saw a car approaching the hills. The guide was alone. 'Where is Miss Quested?' asked Aziz. The guide said that she had gone into a cave. 'Which cave?' The guide did not know. They shouted her name aloud for some time, but there was no reply. Aziz went into several caves but did not find her. 'This is the end of my career!' he thought in despair. 'My guest is lost!' He shouted at the guide who ran away. Left alone on the hill, Aziz suddenly saw her down on the plain, talking to another lady. He was so relieved that he was not surprised at her behavior. Turning to walk back down the hill, he saw her binoculars lying at the entrance of a cave. He picked them up and put them in his pocket.</p><p>When he got back to the camp, he found to his great joy that Fielding was there. 'Fielding! I'm so glad you have come!' he cried.</p>
